# Nashville Housing Market Project

## Project Summary

"Nashville Housing Market Data Cleaning" is a guided project sourced from YouTube, utilizing a dataset acquired from Kaggle. The project focuses on preparing the Nashville Housing Market Dataset for analysis by addressing inconsistencies, missing information, and duplicates. I utilized SQL concepts such as **Common Table Expressions** (CTEs), **Window functions**, along with various **SQL functions** to clean and transform the data. The project produced a more accurate and consistent dataset for in-depth exploration of Nashville's housing market trends.
